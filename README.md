# JavaScript A to Z

## "use strict" 
The `"use strict"` directive in JavaScript enforces a stricter set of rules for your code. It helps catch common mistakes and unsafe actions that JavaScript might otherwise ignore, such as:

- Assigning values to undeclared variables.
- Using reserved keywords as variable names.
- Writing duplicate parameter names in function;
